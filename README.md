# Task-1

I would like to make a little comment regarding Task#1. 

In the task is given that Giant could step over each K-th stair.

In this case, the answer to the question of how many stairs will Giant step in total is N - N/K. 

(He steps over each K-th stair, then in total he steps over N/K stairs. That means that he steps N - N/K stairs.)


But, according to the given examples, he steps over K stairs on each step. In my code, I provide solution for this case.
